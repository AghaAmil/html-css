    <br />

    <h2 class="heading">1. Grid of Boxes</h2>
    <p>Float boxes side by side:</p>

    <div class="clearfix">
      <div class="box" style="background: #999">Some text inside the box.</div>
      <div class="box" style="background: #ccc">Some text inside the box.</div>
      <div class="box" style="background: #eee">Some text inside the box.</div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Note that we also use the clearfix hack to take care of the layout flow,
      and that add the box-sizing property to make sure that the box doesn't
      break due to extra padding. Try to remove this code to see the effect.
    </p>

    <br /><br />

    <h2 class="heading">2. Image Side By Side</h2>
    <p>Float images side by side:</p>

    <div class="clearfix">
      <div class="box1"><img src="assets/img/img_5terre.jpg" alt="Pic1" /></div>
      <div class="box1"><img src="assets/img/img_forest.jpg" alt="Pic2" /></div>
      <div class="box1">
        <img src="assets/img/img_mountains.jpg" alt="Pic3" />
      </div>
    </div>

    <br /><br />

    <h2 class="heading">3. Equal Height Boxes</h2>
    <p>Floating boxes with equal heights:</p>

    <div class="clearfix">
      <div class="box2" style="background: #aaa;">
        <h2>Box One</h2>
        <p>Some content, some content, some content</p>
      </div>
      <div class="box2" style="background: #ccc;">
        <h2>Box Two</h2>
        <p>
          Some content, some content, some content<br />Some content, some
          content, some content<br />Some content, some content, some content<br />Some
          content, some content, some content<br />Some content, some content,
          some content<br />Some content, some content, some content
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <br />

    <p>
      This example not very flexible. It is ok to use CSS height if you can
      guarantee that the boxes will always have the same amount of content in
      them, but that's not always the case. If you try the example above on a
      mobile phone (or resize the browser window), you will see that the second
      box's content will be displayed outside of the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Go back to the tutorial and find another solution, if this is not what you
      want.
    </p>

    <h2 class="heading">3. Flexible Boxes</h2>
    <div class="flex">
      <div class="box3">
        <h2>Box One</h2>
        <p>Some content, some content, some content</p>
      </div>
      <div class="box3">
        <h2>Box Two</h2>
        <p>
          Some content, some content, some content<br />Some content, some
          content, some content<br />Some content, some content, some content<br />Some
          content, some content, some content<br />Some content, some content,
          some content<br />Some content, some content, some content

    <h2 class="heading">4. Some more examples on CSS Layout Float & Clear</h2>

    <p>
      In the paragraph below, the image will float to the right. A dotted black
      border is added to the image. We have also added margins to the image to
      push the text away from the image: 0 px margin on the top and right side,
      15 px margin on the bottom, and 20 px margin on the left side of the
      image.

    <p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">
      <img src="assets/img/w3css.gif" alt="W3S Logo" width="auto" />

    <p>
      In the paragraph above, the div element is 120 pixels wide and it contains
      the image. The div element will float to the right. Margins are added to
      the div to push the text away from the div. Borders and padding are added
      to the div to frame in the picture and the caption.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the paragraph above, the first letter of the text is embedded in a span
      element. The span element has a width that is 0.7 times the size of the
      current font. The font-size of the span element is 400% (quite large) and
      the line-height is 80%. The font of the letter in the span will be in
      "Algerian".
