  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>W3Schools background no-repeat, set position example.</p>
    <p>
      Now the background image is only shown once, and positioned away from the
      text.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this example we have also added a margin on the right side, so the
      background image will never disturb the text.
    </p>

    <br /><br />

    <p>
      The background-attachment property specifies whether the background image
      should scroll or be fixed (will not scroll with the rest of the page).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Tip:</strong> If you do not see any scrollbars, try to resize the
      browser window.
